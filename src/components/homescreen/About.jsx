        <p>
          born and raised on the south coast of Australia, at home within the
          rhythms of nature. An early love of playing with clothing developed
          into a passion for exploring the creative potential of fashion as a
          mode of expression. It wasnâ€™t until adulthood that she recognized how
          her creative calling clashed with her first love and first home:
          nature. From that tension, Savannah Morrow the Label was born.
